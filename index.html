        <h4>X's Lyrics</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I keep deleting X's when we message
            'Cause I forget that things have changed
            Now it's so different, now we're distant
            But damn it, all of it feels so strange
            Deleting X's, I don't get it
            'Cause part of me still feels the same
            And I keep forgetting you're the X I can't erase
            Yeah I don't know what to say, oh-ay, oh-ay
            I'm in my head all day, oh-ay, oh-ay
            Just wanting you to stay, oh-ay
            So tell me if you feel the same
            Yeah I don't know what to say, oh-ay, oh-ay
            I don't know what's okay, oh-ay, oh-ay
            But since you've been away, oh-ay
            Been thinking about the mess I made
            'Cause you're the X I can't erase
            Now I'm deleting pictures, feelin' bitter
            'Cause we're so happy that it hurts
            We're still conversatin', but I hate it
            And X's only make you worse
            Deleting pictures, makes no difference
            Remember saying thousand words
            And I keep on missin'
            I put you as the way you were
            Yeah I don't know what to say, oh-ay, oh-ay
            I'm in my head all day, oh-ay, oh-ay
            Just wanting you to stay, oh-ay
            So tell me if you feel the same
            Yeah I don't know what to say, oh-ay, oh-ay
            I don't know what's okay, oh-ay, oh-ay
            But since you've been away, oh-ay
            Been thinking about the mess I made
            'Cause you're the X I can't erase
            Yeah I don't know what to say, oh-ay, oh-ay
            I'm in my head all day, oh-ay, oh-ay
            Just wanting you to stay, oh-ay
            So tell me if you feel the same
            Yeah I don't know what to say, oh-ay, oh-ay
            I don't know what's okay, oh-ay, oh-ay

          <li>Dance when the bass hit

            I can not lie, bruh

            Pull up in their skirts
            Got yo main thing
            Looking at us like, what's up? (Sup?)
            Spendin' all these Ben's
            So these girls, they showing love (hey)
            How can I be down?
            Everyday I'm counting up

            Ju-just left Miami (ey)

            In the club with my family (ey)
            Going hard with my family
            I don't need a lot
            Just a fucking few
            A few loyal, real G's
